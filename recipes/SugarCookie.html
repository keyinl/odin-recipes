    <p>
        I love sugar cookies that are crisp on the outside and very chewy on the inside. 
        
       <p>Do not try to roll these cookies out, they are meant to be shaped or dropped. </p> 
       <p>This Recipe can easily be made into snickerdoodle cookies by rolling the dough</p>
      
<h2> Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspon baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 1/4 cups margarine</li>
<li>2 cups white sugar</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
<li>1/4 cup white sugar for decoration</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and 2 cups sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then the vanilla. Gradually stir in the dry ingredients until just blended.</li>
<li>Wrap dough with plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
<li>When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
<li>Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and roll the balls in remaining 1/4 cup of sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets and flatten slightly.</li>
<li>Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned at the edges. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
